# Restaurant-Backend-Web-Application-using-Flask-RestAPIs-SQLAlchemy
This project mimics the backend of a restaurant platform using Flask framework and a  database, MySQL. 
Implemented the complete backend system with specific use cases such as signup, login, 
and adding the product as vendor, and ordering the product as a customer etc. Includes the implementation 
of an admin privilege to view and edit access for all the actions happening from vendor as well as customer 
side.
